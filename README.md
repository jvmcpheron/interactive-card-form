# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From styling the page, I have improved my skills in CSS and Bootstrap, and become more comfortable using divs to move things where I want them on the page. Additionally, I have had almost no practice using background images, but I am now much more comfortable handling them when styling a page. 

From the JavaScript portion, I practiced using conditionals and DOM manipulation, and have improved in both of those skills.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - This is the Bootstrap documentation. It helped me with the majority of my styling, and helped me style the page quickly and efficiently.
